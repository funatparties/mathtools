This is a work in progress library of functions for computing various properties of algebraic structures that I'm interested in, particularly exploring the structure of [cyclotomic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotomic_field). 

Currently, I have developed functions to calculate cycle graphs and subgroup lattices for automorphism groups of cyclic groups. These automorphism groups are isomorphic to the Galois groups of cyclotomic fields.

In progress is developing nice visualisation of the cycle graphs using the algorithm described by [Bertault (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0020-0190(00)00042-9) (at least for cases where the graph is indeed planar).
